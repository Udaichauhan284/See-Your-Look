# See-Your-Look

Developed a cool website in which you can see your cartoon character by your name.

 See Your Look
 NetLify : https://seeyourlook.netlify.app/
 
In this I used API(Application Programming Interface) for fetching the data and showing character.

API just allow application to communicate with another application.
An API is a messanger that delivers your request to provider that you are requesting it and then delivers the respone back to you.
An API is not a database. It is an access point to an app that can access a database.
